# Installation

There are two ways of executing this script: Either locally on the host machine or within a Docker container 

### Installing all dependencies locally

**Note: Make sure you have installed golang properly before running installation script locally.**

```
$ sudo chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh
```

### Building the docker container 

When using the docker version, everything will be installed automatically. You just have to execute the following commands: 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/KathanP19/JSFScan.sh
$ cd JSFScan.sh/
$ docker build . -t jsfscan
```

In order to start the pre-configured container run the following command: 

```
$ docker run -it jsfscan "/bin/bash"
```

After that an interactive bash session should be opened. 

# Usage
Target List should be with `https://` and `http://` use httpx or httprobe for this.

And if you want to add cookie then edit the command at line 23 `cat $target | hakrawler -js -cookie "cookie here" -depth 2 -scope subs -plain >> jsfile_links.txt` 

**NOTE: If you feel tool is slow just comment out hakrawler line at 23 in JSFScan.sh script , but it might result in little less jsfileslinks.**
